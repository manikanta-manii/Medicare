# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
# #   end

# User.create(name:"Admin",phone_number:"9999999999",email:"admin@gmail.com",password:"Admin@123",role:0);
# Specialization.create(name:"Cardiologist",description:"Heart related doctor !");
# Specialization.create(name:"Neurologist",description:"A neurologist treats conditions of the nerves, spine, and brain");
# Specialization.create(name:"General Physician",description:" a primary care doctor who specializes in family medicine and can treat a wide range of physical and mental problems for patients of all ages and genders.");
# Specialization.create(name:"Gynecologist",description:"A gynecologist diagnoses and treats issues with female reproductive organs. ");
